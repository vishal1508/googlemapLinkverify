Here’s an example README.md file for your Flask-based project that processes Excel files to validate Google Maps links:

Excel Google Maps Validator
This project is a Flask-based web application for processing Excel files. It validates URLs in the Reference Link column of an uploaded Excel file to check if they are valid Google Maps addresses and adds a new column, Valid Map Address, with the validation results.

Features
Upload an Excel file with a Reference Link column.
Validate URLs in the Reference Link column to check if they point to Google Maps.
Append a new column, Valid Map Address, to the Excel file with True or False based on validation.
Preserve the structure of other columns and data in the Excel file.
Download the processed Excel file.
